# 19 Progressive Web Applications (PWA): Text Editor

## My Task

Explore the completed J.A.T.E application that has been provided to gain a deeper understanding of how a Progressive Web Application (PWA) is properly configured in a web application.

My task was to record a video between 90-seconds to 2-minutes in length of you narrating a screen share of the J.A.T.E application while explaining the key components that comprise it's PWA.

## User Story

```md
AS A developer
I WANT to better understand how a PWA is setup
SO THAT I can explain the purpose in a technical setting
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a completed text editor web application
WHEN I showcase the application in the video
THEN I should be able to explain all aspects of a PWA
WHEN I show the webpack plugins
THEN I explain how I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file
WHEN I open the text editor
THEN I show that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage
WHEN I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window
THEN I explain how the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB
WHEN I reopen the text editor after closing it
THEN I explain how the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB
